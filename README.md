# algorithms & data structures

A playground to implement some interesting algorithms. Most of these will be implemented in either Erlang, Scala or Clojure depending on my current fancy. The goal of the project is to experiment with the languages and learn about the algorithms and data structures.

## Planned algorithms

- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A*
- Timsort
- Cycle sort
- Boyer–Moore–Horspool algorithm
- MD5

## Planned data structures

- doubly linked list
- self-organizing list
- skip list
- binary tree
- red-black tree
- fibonacci heap
- radix tree
